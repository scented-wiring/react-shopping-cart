# React/Typescript Shopping Cart

Add and remove products to a shopping cart and keep track of running total.

I devloped this project, following one of [Thomas Weibenfalk's video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfmL6bGbiN8), as an exercise to understand how to utilise Typescript in tandem with React.

## Instructions

Clone the repo, install dependencies and run with (`npm start`)
